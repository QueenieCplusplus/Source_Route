# Source_Route

Source-Route Bridging is designed for interconnecting token ring segments into a bigger LAN.

Originally, Source-Route Bridging was deemed as a universal method for creating large-scale networks. However in actual world, source-route can not meet client's requirement.

# Premises of Source-Route Bridging to be based upon (Non-Transparent)

# Config of Source-Route

- [x] Each Ring shall be assigned a unique number.

- [x] Each bridge shall be assigned a unique number with each ring to which the bridge is connected.

# Likelyhood between Source-Route & Transparent-Route

Like a transparently bridged LAN, source-route allows redundant paths to exist with a single source-route bridged route LAN. This redundant path helps to be utilized to recover from network component failure.
