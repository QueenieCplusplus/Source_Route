# Source_Route

Source-Route Bridging is designed for interconnecting token ring segments into a bigger LAN.

Originally, Source-Route Bridging was deemed as a universal method for creating large-scale networks. However in actual world, source-route can not meet client's requirement.

# Concept of Source-Route Bridging



# Likelyhood between Source-Route & Transparent-Route

Like a transparently bridged LAN, source-route allows redundant paths to exist with a single source-route bridged route LAN. This redundant path helps to be utilized to recover from network component failure.
